# Music-App
A Music App (in progress) . Will add more features.
A music application built with HTML , CSS , JavaScript , currently under development. 
Features include 
1. Search 
2. Music playback
3. Adding to favorites (creating a favorites playlist)
4. User-friendly UI .

I integrated it with the Jamendo API for dynamic song recommendations. The project already includes a functional login/registration system developed using PHP and MySQL. Currently, I am working on integrating all the components (login/registration, music player, and API integration) into a single cohesive application to ensure seamless functionality.

Will add more features. I will also add the feature to track the user-specific change using SQL and a song database backend.
